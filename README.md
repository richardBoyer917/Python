## Programs/Projects in this repository -
1. **Simple Calculator** - This is a small program which can implement basic mathematical operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc.).

2. **Dice roll simulator** - This program simulates the rolling of a 6-sided die. It shoots out random numbers from 1 to 6.

3. **Guess the number** - This is a simple one-player game that anyone can implement and play. The computer chooses a random number, which we have to guess in a specific number of guesses.

4. **Check leap year** - This is a simple program which takes user input and checks if the entered year is a leap year or not.

5. **Madlibs** - A very simple and funny game. The computer/program asks the user to enter specific types of words (like nouns, pronouns etc.). The result is a fun script which you get to read and laugh at! (Console version of the standard Madlibs game!)

6. **Contact list** - A program which stores, edits and displays phone numbers for users. I have tried to make it as user-friendly as possible!

7. **Username generator** - A fun program which generates fun usernames.
